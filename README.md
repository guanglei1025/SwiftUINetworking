### Steps to Run the App

Build project with Xcode 16

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I only plan to complete this project in 1 day after work, so this coding practice focused on showing the ablity of the following skill set
* Showing the ability to architecture the app with design pattern like MVVM (aka ViewModel)
* Ablity to follow SOLID princeples (e.g. decouple `ViewModel` and NetworkService` with protocol) 
* Advanced Swift Concurrency: Async-Await 
* Protocol based generic services 
* Dependency injections 
* Unit testing 

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
Plan to use 1 day for this assiment after work. I want to spend more time to demostrate how I architecture the app and good coding practice

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Because of the time limitations, I didn't spend too much time on each of the sessions only showing a guesture 

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
* I didn't have time to implement any image Caching logic in the project.
* Didn't spend to much time on the network layer 
* I didn't spend time on the UI and didn't add a details screen with `NavigationPath`
* I didn't spend to much time on the unit test 


### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
NO

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
Very good coding practice
